# AR Book Cover for Fire Cat
This project is a Unity project using Vuforia's engine to display a front and back bookcover for one of my favorite childhood books, Fire Cat. After cloning the repo and opening the project in Unity, make sure to navigate to the MainScene scene in /Assets/Scenes. Double check that your Vuforia License and camera settings are correct in the Vuforia Engine Configuration.
